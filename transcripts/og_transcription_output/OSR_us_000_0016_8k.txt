The boy was there when the sun rose. A rod is used to catch pink salmon. The source of the huge river is a clear spring. Kick the ball straight and follow through. Help the woman get back to her feet. A pot of tea helps to pass the evening. Smoky fires lack flame and heat. The soft cushion broke the man's ball. The salt breeze came across from the sea. The girl at the booth sold 50 ponds.
